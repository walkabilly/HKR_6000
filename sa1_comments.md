## Comments on assignment 1 

## 1. Watch out with descriptive statistics for Qualitative variables

For a qualitative variable the mean is not useful. When you present descriptives for a qualitative variable you will need to present the n (number of cases in each group) and the % (percent of cases in each group compared to the total). 

## 2. Check your calculations

2.1 For the age_category variable many people did not calcualted correctly and had a small number of people who were not coded correctly. You can check your work by going a cross-tabulation between the age variable and the new age_category variables. 

2.2 Remember in our BMI variable that the cause of the outliers is our weight variable. Make sure that you understand and describe the cause of the problem. You need to fix weight and rerun BMI calculations (after checking that the formula is correct) before you can really comment on whether BMI has outliers. We will work on this next week. 

## 3. Weight outliers versus incorrect values

The weight variable has some problems. The low end values for weight are very low. They are not biologically plausible. It is not possible from someone aged 18 years and being around 100cm tall to weigh 10kg. I would consider these values to be not plausible but they are not really outliers. The histogram shows that the low end values for weight are low, but are definitely consistent with the distribution. They are not way off of the histogram. I would consider these values incorrect and not plausible, but not outliers.
