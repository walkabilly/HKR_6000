## Writing it up 

Sections on how to write the results of specific statistical tests. This is mostly summarized from Dr. Angela Loucks-Atkinson. 

### Scatter Plot

```{}
Figure 1 illustrates a scatter plot of activity restriction in sports and recreation and depression.  This graph illustrates that there does not generally appear to be a linear relationship between activity restriction in sports and recreation and depression.  However, it does appear that in general, individuals with greater activity restriction did experience more depressive symptoms.  Additionally, the graph illustrates that are several outliers; in particular individuals who have relatively low levels of activity restriction but have very high levels of depression.

### Correlation

```{}
A bivariate correlation was calculated between activity restriction in sports and recreation and depression. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was chosen as the variables are not normally distributed (Field, 2012). These variables were significantly, positively and moderately correlated (ρ = .25, p = .001) indicating that there was a relation between greater restriction in sports and recreation activities and greater levels of depression.

### Independent T-test

```{}
An independent t-test was calculated and results are as follows. On average, participants experienced greater anxiety to real spiders (M = 47.0, SD = 11.03, SE = 2.68) compared to viewing the picture of the spider (M = 40.0, SD = 9.29, SE= 2.68, t(22) = 1.68, p > .05). This difference was not statistically significant (t(22) = 1.68, p > .05); however, the effect size of the this difference was medium (r = .34). Finally, a 95% confidence interval for the true mean difference in anxiety level is (-1.63, 15.63), suggesting there is weak evidence that holding a real spider produces higher anxiety than holding a picture of a spider.

### One way ANOVA

```{}
A one-way ANOVA was performed on the data set. There was a significant difference among the treatment groups (F (1, 12) = 5.12, p = .025). To determine group differences, post hoc analyses was performed using the Tukey HSD test due to the fact that group sizes were equal and group variances were similar (Field, 2009). The low dose group (M = 3.2, SD = 1.30, SD = 0.58) was not significantly different (p = .52, 95% CI [-3.366, 1.366]) from the placebo group (M = 2.2, SD = 1.30, SD = 0.58); nor where there significant differences (p = .15, 95% CI -4.166, 0.566]) between the low dose and high dose groups (M = 5.0, SD = 1.58, SD = 0.71). However, significant differences were found between the placebo and high dose groups (p = .021, 95% CI [- 5.166, -0.424]). Therefore, there appears to be a dose-specific response of Viagra on libido; only high doses of Viagra have therapeutic effects.

### Linear regression

```{}
A multiple regression model was analyzed to determine which of the nine restricted activities at Time 1 most strongly predicts level of depression at Time 2 among unpaid caregivers (see Table 1). Overall, the model accounts for 21.7% of the variance in participation in physically active leisure activities (R2 = .217, Radj2 = .173). The model is a significant fit of the data (F(9, 159) = 4.89, p < .001). All of the restricted activities were positively associated with depression (i.e., greater restriction predicted greater depression) with the exception of ‘caring for others’ which was negatively associated. Thus, being restricted in the ability to care for others predicted lower depression scores at Time 2 while for all other predictors greater activity restricted as associated with higher depression. Among the nine restricted activities, only ‘caring for others’ (ß = -0.208, SE = 0.905, t = -2.102, p = .37) and ‘going shopping’ (ß = 0.247, SE = 1.004, t = 2.337, p = 0.21) significantly predicted depression with restriction in shopping being the strongest predictor.
